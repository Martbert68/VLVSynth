# VLVSynth
Very Light Video Synth
This is destined for the Raspberry Pi. It is inteneded to make very simple patterns but is now gaining a feedback system
and also a control panel with sliders and switches.

My intention is to connect to the CV from a Eurorack Audio Sythn and have it respond. The A to D is on the way.
